List of item and each item is in the form of an string array [name, relevance, price] where each value relevance and price are integers as string. 
After sorting the items by (name: 0, relevance: 1, price: 2) the programer is trying to find out a list of item displayed in a chosen page.

Given a list of items, the sort colum, the sort order (0:ascending, 1:descending) the number of item to be display in each page and page number. 
Determine the list of item names in the specified page while respecting the item order (page number start at 0)
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the size of the array items.
The next line contains an integer, 3, denoting the attribute count of each item.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 <= i <= n) contains three space-separated strings representing items[i] in the form [name, relevance, price].
The next line contains an integer, sortParameter, denoting the column in items to sort on.
The next line contains an integer, sortOrder, 0 = ascending, 1 = descending.
The next line contains an integer, itemsPerPage, denothing the number of items displayed in a page.
The next line contains an integer, pageNumber, denothing the page where to list the items.

Function description
====================
Complete the function fetchItemsToDisplay in the editor below.

fetchItemsToDisplay has the following parameter(s):
    string items[n][3]: a 2D array of arrays of strings the form [name, relevance, price] 
    int sortParameter: the column of the items to sort on
    int sortOrder: 0 = ascending and 1 = descending
    int itemsPerPage: the number of items per page
    int pageNumber: the page number to display item names

Returns:
    string pageItems[m]: array of item names on the requested page in the order they are displayed

Example
=======
items = [[item1, 10, 15],[item2, 3, 4],[item3, 17, 8]]
sortParameter = 1
sortOrder = 0
itemsPerPage = 2
pageNumber = 1

- There are n = 3 items
- Sort them by (relevance: 1) in ascending order (items = [[item2, 3, 4],[item1, 10, 15],[item3, 17, 8]]).
- Display up to 2 items in each page
- The page 0 contains 2 item names [item2, item1] and page 1 contains only 1 item name, result = item3.

Explanation 0
=============
The items are sorted by name, items column 0, in ascending order -> [p1, p2].
Each page contains 1 item, so page 0 contains only the first item in the sorted list, p1.

- There are n = 2 items (items = [[p1, 1, 2],[p2, 2, 1]]).
- Sort them by (name: 0) in ascending order (items = [[p1, 1, 2],[p2, 2, 1]]).
- Up to 1 item  can be displayed per page.
- The page 0 contains 1 item name p1 in the sorted list [p1, p2].

Constraints
===========
- 1 <= n < 10^5
- 1 <= m <= n
- 0 <= relevance, price < 10^8
- Relevance and price are both integers
- 1 <= itemsPerPage < 20
- 0 <= pageNumber < 10

Explanation 0
The items are sorted by name, items column 0, in ascending order -> [p1, p2].
Each page contains 1 item, so page 0 contains only the first item in the sorted list, p1.

- There are n = 2 items (items = [[p1, 1, 2],[p2, 2, 1]]).
- Sort them by (name: 0) in ascending order (items = [[p1, 1, 2],[p2, 2, 1]]).

vjrrisdfxe

Explanation 1
- There are n = 4 items (items = [[owjevtkuyv, 58584272, 62930912],[rpaqgbjxik, 9425650, 96088250],[dfbkasyqcn, 37469674, 46363902],[vjrrisdfxe, 18666489, 88046739]]).
- Sort them by (price: 2) in descending order (items = [[rpaqgbjxik, 9425650
